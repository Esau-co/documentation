## Release June 2024

### A Whole New Search Experience

We have completely rebuilt our search engine. With a focus on enhancing your search experience, this update brings a dynamic approach to finding content, improved performance, and a preview of the results before diving in. Organize your search results with customizable sorting options and easily navigate through content categories with refined filters. In addition, a new Module for third party search engines will follow, which will allow search results from third party resources to be displayed within your HumHub. More on this Module will follow soon.

### Deactivation Of Module Use In User Profiles/Spaces

Until now, all users could activate Modules (e.g. Files, Wiki) in their profiles. With the new version, this feature is now optional and can be deactivated by the network administrator. This gives administrators the flexibility to decide whether modules can be used in user profiles. This option is, of course, also available for Spaces within the network.
### New People Filtering

People filter is now dynamic. It adjusts based on the characteristics of the users you are filtering, narrowing down your matches and making your search more intuitive and faster. The filters automatically adapt in real-time to the selected criteria, ensuring only relevant options are shown based on the current context.

### And much more..

- Added online indicator to People Cards, Member Snippet, My Profile
- Added ability to send messages to users with pending registrations
- Emojis are now rendered correctly in emails
- Removed general setting "Server Timezone"
- Fixed LDAP encryption labels and added ability to partially ignore DNs
